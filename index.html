        <p> Barbie may look young, but the iconic doll actually turned 60 in 2019. And while she's one of the most well-known toys the world has ever seen, there are still many facts about Barbie that are hardly common knowledge. She's lived a life in plastic that's truly fantastic. Keep reading to learn some interesting tidbits about the world's most famous fashionable doll.While Barbie may seem as American as apple pie, she was modeled after a German doll named Lilli. As cultural critic M.G. Lord notes in Forever Barbie, the doll was based on a '50s comic strip about a high-end call girl that appeared in the German tabloid Bild-Zeitung.

The Lilli doll inspired by these comics was meant as a gag gift for adults—but when Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler saw her while traveling in Europe, it sparked the idea for Barbie. "I didn't then know who Lilli was or even that its name was Lilli," she told Lord. "I only saw an adult-shape body that I had been trying to describe for years, and our guys [at Mattel] said couldn't be done."We have Barbara Handler, daughter of Mattel co-founders Ruth and Elliot, to thank for Barbie. When Barbara was a child, she would play with paper dolls for hours on end. According to Mattel's website, "this sparked Ruth's vision to create a 3-D doll for girls to play out their dreams."In honor of her source of inspiration—her daughter Barbara—Handler named the Barbie doll Barbara Millicent Roberts. Ironically, though, the real Barbie was 17 by the time the doll debuted, and therefore was not particularly interested in being associated with the child's toy.

"[Kids] would come up to me and say, 'So you're the Barbie doll,'" Handler told People in 1989. "I did not like it. It is very strange to have a doll named after you."When it came time to create Barbie, Handler assigned Mattel designer Jack Ryan to the task. A Yale alum, Ryan worked for an aerospace company prior to joining the team at Mattel. In fact, he helped design the government's Hawk and Sparrow III missile systems before helping to create Barbie.After designing the original Barbie doll, Jack Ryan married Gilligan's Island actress Zsa Zsa Gabor in 1975. At that point, though, the designer's relationship with Mattel was rocky, as he and Handler couldn't agree on who actually came up with the idea for the doll.

"He couldn't think of anything original," Handler told The New Yorker. "But once you led him, and said what he should make, then he figured out how to make it happen." In 1980, Ryan sued Mattel for royalties and settled out of court.Barbie was introduced to the world on March 9, 1959, at the New York Toy Fair. And when Greiner & Hausser, the company behind the Lilli doll, saw Barbie, they were not happy. They accused Mattel of copying elements of her design—especially her hip joint—without their permission. Greiner & Hausser sued Mattel for infringement, and they settled out of court in 1963. A year later, Mattel bought the rights to Lilli.According to Mattel's official Barbie website, Barbie is from the fictional town of Willows, Wisconsin. And even though it's not a real place, the state of Wisconsin proudly claims her as a native daughter. An early version of the doll is even featured in the Wisconsin Historical Museum.According to Time, Mattel became the first year-round sponsor of The Mickey Mouse Club in 1955. TV commercials were a novel advertising approach for toys at the time, and Mattel is largely credited with being the first company to broadcast commercials aimed at kids. When the company launched Barbie, they heavily promoted the doll to Mickey Mouse Club viewers. She became a hit as soon as the commercials were in regular rotation.Considering the steady stream of TV commercials Mattel has produced for Barbie since her debut, it's not too surprising some celebrities got their big breaks via Barbie commercials. Mila Kunis, Fergie, and The Brady Bunch's Maureen McCormick are just some of the celebs who appeared in ads for the doll before they became household names themselves.The original Barbie was available to purchase as either a blonde or a brunette. But according to Forbes, "the blonde doll sold so much better, the brunette was soon relegated to the back of the shelf."
